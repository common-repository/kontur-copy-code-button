**Uninstalling**

This plugin cleans up after itself. All plugin settings will be removed from your database when the plugin is uninstalled via the Plugins screen.


== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

1. Upload `kontur-copy-code-button.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory

2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

3. Go to WordPress Admin > Appearance > Copy Code Button and change your settings

Note: To use your normal theme button settings 'empty' the background color setting and the button text color setting. And also set the appropriate class(es) in the settings field.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where do I find the settings? =

Under WordPress Admin > Appearance Copy Code Button or click the link 'Settings' under the plugin in your WordPress Admin Plugins section.

= Do I have to configure a he** of a lot before I can use it?  =

Actually, you don't. Not really. Once the plugin is activated, it will add its magic to your "code blocks". The default text on the button is "Copy me", with "Code copied" appearing once the code has been copied to the clipboard.


= What icons can I use =

If you want to use an icon, you can either use our predefined one, choose one from your library or simply upload your own

= Can I set classes to trigger the ones already used within my theme? =

Yes, on the settings page you can add classes. 



= Will there be more options in the future?  =

Yes. We are working on integrating the options as well into the Gutenberg blocks, fo e.g. having individial "copy texts" for each block. As well we want to offer more copy-icons. 

= Do you offer any other plugins I could use =

Yes, we got three of them you'd might like:

* [kontur font-o-mat](https://wordpress.org/plugins/kontur-font-o-mat/) for going wild with fonts on the Gutenberg editor
* [No All in one SEO Premium Nags](https://wordpress.org/plugins/no-aioseop-nags/) to stop the premium version spam AND to add your own CSS to the WP backend. Works as well with YOAST SEO
* [kontur Admin Style](https://wordpress.org/plugins/kontur-admin-style/) Set your own admin backend style AND login page

= I need something else. Can I hire you? =

Yes. Please get in touch via email [email](mailto:hello@kontur.us) with a brief description of your requirements and budget for the project and we will start something else together.
